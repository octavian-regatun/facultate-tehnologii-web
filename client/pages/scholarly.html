                The software being specified is a web application aggregator designed to facilitate the management of
                photographs across multiple platforms. Its purpose is to allow users to retrieve personal images from
                the two mentioned platforms, along with associated comments, ratings, and other relevant
                metadata such as tags, share counts, and dimensions. If necessary, additional supported platforms will
                be added. The application will also provide advanced search capabilities and enable users to upload new
                photographs to these platforms. Additionally, users will have the ability to edit graphical content
                within the application using CSS filters and masks.

            <p>
                This product is designed to be used as an assessment method for the Web Technologies subject. It is
                developed from scratch, without using any pre-made frameworks from the internet. However, it will use
                its own primitive framework in order to simplify the product deployment. Therefore, this website should
                be self-contained in the front-end part. As for the back-end, this website will use some external APIs
                to allow the average end-user to connect to different social media platforms, in order to aggregate its
                files.

                <li>Multi-criteria search capabilities.</li>
                <li>Apply filters or masks to the aggregated photos.</li>
                <li>Ability to select a number of photos to create a photo collage.</li>

                In the first part of the development, the website will be stored locally on the users' personal
                computer. It can be downloaded from this <a
                    href="https://github.com/octavian-regatun/facultate-tehnologii-web">GitHub</a> page.
            </p>
            <p>As for the end user perspective, this product shouldn't require too high specifications, as an internet
                connection and a web browser will suffice. Even if the used browser isn't compatible with all of the
                product's features, there should be some fallback methods, allowind the user experience to be as close
                as possible to the maximum potentional of the website.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that our product will be available on any type of device (PCs, phones, tablets,
                etc.). Therefore, its design shall be responsive.

        <section id="design">
            <h3><span>3.4 </span>Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
            <p>
                In the case of our website, significant constraints revolve around the integration and utilization of
                various APIs from social media platforms. These APIs dictate the methods by which we can access and
                aggregate photos from the choosen platforms. In our research, we inquired about several social media
                applications, focusing on their guidelines and limitations imposed in the APIs
                (such as rate limits, data usage restrictions, authentication requirements, and compliance with platform
                policies). For example, we found out that Instagram limits the usage of aggregation to 150 photos per
                hour.</p>

            <p>With the information presented above, we can conclude that we will not face any timing or memory
                limitations, as the APIs restrictions are the main concern of our product.</p>

            <p>As for the database, we will use PostgreSQL. This database will store all of our users' data, including
                their
                passwords which will be hashed before saving in order to maintain the bare minimum of security.
                Regarding the security, the users inputs will be treated as normal text in order to avoid code
                injection.

        <section id="userDocumentation">
            <h3><span>3.5 </span>User Documentation</h3>
            <p>
                Our users can find a <code>README.md</code> file on the previously specified GitHub Repository. The
                choosen design for our product should be simple enough to make the user experience as intuitive as
                possible, thus overcomind the need for documentation. However, there will be a page which will inform
                all the users of the limitations imposed by our website, mainly the number of photos that can be
                collected in a period of time from another application. If any, the limitations of uploading a photo to
                these websites will be also documented.

                This chapter describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the
                users. Our website aims to use a minimalist style in order to make the user flow/navigation simpler. The
                choosen design should enhance the user experience. Because the design is so simple, there should be a
                minimal difference between the Web and Mobile versions. Even the <code>navbar</code> on the left can be
                permanently visible, as it's width is negligible.

                    There are quite a few software components that require a user interface. They will be presented
                    one by one with a short description and a design concept in the form of a photo. In the later
                    chapters they will be presented in depth if needed.

                M-PIC is designed to be accessible on any screen device as said before. Responsive design principles are
                implemented to ensure optimal viewing and interaction, regardless the screen size and resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The website interact with hardware components to receive user input (e.g. mouse clicks, touch events for
                phones/tablets, swipes, keyboard inputs) and transmit data to and from the server. The photos will be
                transmited to the server among with their metadata, using Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure
                (HTTPS).

                M-PIC will not use any already built frameworks, it will rely on its own framework: <i>regacip</i>.
                However, it will use RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the M-PIC website and
                external services, the most obvious one being the supported social media platforms. As
                for the database, we have choosen to use PostgreSQL - it follows the relational model and stores data in
                tables with rows and columns, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of structured data.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application will be available on any operating system, the only requirement being an operational

                The design for this component was presented in the previous chapter. However, unlike the log in system,
                there are still things to be covered. In order to access this page, the user needs to connect to an
                external social media platform (Instagram or Youtube). After a successful login, the user can select the
                number of aggregated photos. The default value will be 10 and they will be sorted by the post date, the
                newest ones coming first. If the user wants to retrieve a specific photo, it will be choosen via an ID.

            <p>
                Each photo or video from the grid can be clicked on. When selected, a caroussel style pop-up with cards
                will show up, bluring the rest of the screen. Under the selected pop-up card, there will be two
                neighbour cards - slightly rotated and blured. The buttons on these side cards won't work. These cards
                will contain relevant info about the post
                (like comments, number of likes, a share button etc). There will also be two
                arrows (left and right) that will allow the user to iterate through his aggregated media files. This
                action will move the cards to left or right, simulating a caroussel. This feature will be available on
                phones too, the only difference being that there won't be an animation, the two neighbour cards being
                hidden. To exit this cards interface the user can click on any part of the blurred website or on the X
                button of the current card.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of the card is as follows (from top to bottom): photo, description, number of likes &
                utility buttons (share, edit), comments (will have an invisible
                scrollbar if there is too much text).

                The aggregated media will store more than the photo itself - there will also be the post date, number of
                likes, comments, dimensions etc. Therefore, an user will have the ability to search between his
                photos/videos using more than one keyword. Also, the results can be filtered based on the platform, a
                data range etc. The search bar will be visible at all times on the Desktop version as well as on the
                phone version. However, the top <code>navbar</code> will suffer a loss on the phone version - the
                current page name won't be displayed anymore to let room for the search bar.

                On the pop-up cards that appear when selecting a photo, next to the share button there will be an edit
                icon. When clicked, a <code>div</code> will appear with some sliders. These sliders will control
                different properties of the photo, such as brightness, blur, contrast etc. The user will also have the
                option to save the edited image in his personal device. When this option is active, the edit icon will
                have the color slightly changed to let the user know it is pressed. Hopefully, the design is intuitive
                enough to let the user know to press again when he wants to exit the editor.

                As mentioned before, the user has the ability to create collages from his photos. In order to achieve
                this, the desired photos must be selected using the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+LMB</code>. When a
                photo is selected, it will be zoomed in, a checkmark will apear on a top corner of the card. The photo
                can be deselected by following the same shortcut. If the user accidentally clicks on a photo without
                using the Control key, he can exit from the pop-up modal and continue from where he left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, a button will appear at the bottom of the screen allowing the user to create a collage and save it

                As our site works with media from other associated platforms, there are risks on aggregating their
                content, such as data breaches, API misuse or platform policy violations. However, these risks should be
                taken care of by the used APIs (they should prevent unauthorized access to user data, rate limits,
                etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                M-PIC must comply with regulations such as GDPR to ensure protection of user data (secure
                authentification mechanisms, ecyption of sensitive data). As for the uploaded or aggregated photos,
                M-PIC is only an intermediary application, therefore the linked social media applications will have
                control over the distributed photos. M-PIC won't allow the user to edit photos in order to impersonate,
                allowind the user only to make minor changes to his photos (such as modifying the contrast, hue, blur).
            </p>
            <p>
                This web application won't have access to sensitive data from the linked social media accounts, as the
                connection will be made externally.

                transmission between clients and server.
            </p>
            <p>
                M-PIC website must implement measures to prevent code injection vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection
