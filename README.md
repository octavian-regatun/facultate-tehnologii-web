# M-PIC
- Octavian-Ștefan Regatun & Ciprian-Florin Gînțu (2A1 2023-2024)

## Folder Structure

- `regacip` folder - source code of our library
- `site` folder - source code of the site (pages, components)
- `compiled-site` folder - source code of the site after being compiled by our framework `regacip`

## Library
### Purpose
- should enable us to write html pages by splitting the page into components
- components enable us to write more readable, following the single responsability rule and keeping things simple and also encourages reusability of parts of code into other pages too
- pages will be divided into components which will make up the entire page
- a component is a folder under `components` folder with one `.html` file, one or more `.js` files and one or more `.css` files
- a page is a folder under `pages` folder with one `.html` file and one or more `.css` files and one or more `.js` files
